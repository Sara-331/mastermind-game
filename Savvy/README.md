# Mastermind Game

A simple console game in C#.

Guess a secret code of 4 different digits (0-8) in limited tries.  
After each guess, you see how many digits are correct and well placed or misplaced.

Run from terminal:  
- Use `-c [CODE]` to set the secret code (`-c 0123`)  
- Use `-t [ATTEMPTS]` to set number of tries (10)

When the game starts it says:  
"Can you break the code? Enter a valid guess"

If you win, it says:  
"Congratz! You did it!"

If wrong, it shows how many digits are well placed and misplaced.
